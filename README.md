# Neural-Net-Examples

Each folder contains a different neural net I've constructed.  Mostly these are very simple neural nets I've worked on to understand how to construct them, the decisions you make, etc. 

CNN-Example-Cats-Dogs is the first convolutional neural net I built for image recognition.

RNN-Example-Stocks is a recurrent neural net built with LSTM units.  It's predicts a stocks price for the next day. Obviously the chances of this doing well are slim (since I presumably can't beat the market with a neural net in 100 lines of code), but it's still a fun example.
